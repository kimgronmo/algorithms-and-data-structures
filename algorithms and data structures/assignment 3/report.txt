To represent the network I use a collection of nodes in a weighted graph. 
The weights were both time and cost. With a given search preference the 
program finds the shortest path to any node using Dijkstra's algorithm.

Since no edge has negative time or cost this algorithm should always work.
If the number of nodes is |v| and the number of edges for each node is |e|,
the algorithm scans the nodes and updates the minimum for each edge. The
running time is the given as a combination of the number of nodes and edges.
It will have a running time of O(|e|*log(|v|)+|v|*log(|v|))=O(|e|*log(|v|)).
